# CNNs-CIFAR-10_MNIST

Develops an image classification system for object recognition. Uses the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets as base and designs two CNNs: one original model designed by me, and a recreation of the historical AlexNet.

To run this project, open the .ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook. The notebook consists of sequential code cells that should be executed in order to ensure the correct flow of data and computations. Before running the notebook, clone this repository to your local machine and make sure all required libraries are installed—either via the provided requirements.txt file or by manually installing the necessary packages.
